## About Graphene

Graphene is a fully featured Application Development and Content Management Engine built on top of Laravel 5.

Note: This project is in the process of merging with the Binghamton University Open Source "Graphene" project which runs the my.binghamton.edu user experience platform / portal.  (https://github.com/BinghamtonUniversity/Graphene) While the code is largely functional (though not quite production ready), it is not recommended for use outside of a development environment at this time. This merger effort (including proper documentation of installation, configuration, and general setup) is expected to be completed by early first quarter of 2018.
